# Project Description  
This project addresses the problem of accurately predicting house prices based on a variety of characteristics such as area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, number of stories, parking availability, furnishing status, and other features. Determining the fair market value of a house is a complex task because prices are influenced by multiple interacting factors rather than a single attribute. The objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between these characteristics and house prices, and to build a predictive model capable of estimating the price of a house given its attributes.

# Project Motivation  
The motivation behind this project stems from the importance of the real estate market as one of the key drivers of the economy. Buyers, sellers, and investors often rely on price estimations to make informed decisions, yet manual estimation can be unreliable due to the many factors that affect property values. By applying data mining techniques to this dataset, we can better understand how specific features such as area, furnishing status, or parking influence house prices. Developing a predictive model for house pricing is valuable not only for improving transparency in property valuation but also for supporting decision-making processes in real estate transactions.
