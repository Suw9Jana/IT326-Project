# Project Description  
This project aims to predict house prices using different features such as area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, number of stories, parking spaces, furnishing status, and other details about the house. The problem we want to solve is that house prices are not easy to estimate because many factors affect them at the same time. The goal of the project is to study how these features are related to the price and to build a model that can give a price prediction for a house based on its characteristics.  

# Project Motivation  
The reason for choosing this project is that the real estate market is very important, and both buyers and sellers need fair and accurate price estimations to make good decisions. Since house prices depend on many features, it can be difficult to know the right value without using data analysis. By working on this dataset, we can learn how different factors such as area or furnishing influence the price and create a model that helps in making the estimation process more reliable and useful.
